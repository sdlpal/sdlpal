# CD: Indicates which type of CD audio source to use. Valid types include 'RAW',
#     'OGG' and 'MP3'. 'RAW' means use the SDL 1.2's CDAudio API (default when
#     compiled with SDL 1.2), 'OGG' means use files named as '100xx.ogg' inside
#     the 'ogg' directory (default when compiled with SDL 2.0), while 'MP3'
#     means use files named as '100xx.mp3' inside the 'mp3' directory.
#CD=OGG

# MUSIC: Indicates which type of music source to use. Valid types include 
#        'RIX', 'MIDI', 'OGG' and 'MP3'. 'RIX' means use the RIX music (default),
#        'MIDI' means midi (either in 'mus.mkf' or inside 'musics' directory),
#        'OGG' means use files named as 'xx.ogg' inside the 'ogg' directory, while
#        'MP3' means use files named as 'xx.mp3' inside the 'mp3' directory.
#Music=RIX

# OPLCore: Indicates the OPL emulator core to use. Valid types include 'DBFLT'
#          (default), 'MAME', 'DBINT' and 'NUKED'.
#OPLCore=DBFLT

# OPLChip: Indicates the kind of OPL chip to be emulated. Valid types include 'OPL2'
#          (default) and 'OPL3'. Note: the 'NUKED' core does not support 'OPL2'.
#OPLChip=OPL2

# Stereo: Indicates whether to use mono audio or stereo audio. Non-zero means to use
#         stereo audio (default), while zero means only use mono audio.
#Stereo=1

# UseSurroundOPL: Indicates whether to use surround opl emulator or not. Non-zero
#                 means to using (default), while zero means not to use. Only

#UseSurroundOPL=1

# SampleRate: Indicates which sample rate to use, valid values include 44100 (default),
#             and 22050. Other values (<=48000) are supported but not recommended.
#SampleRate=44100

# OPLSampleRate: Indicates which sample rate to use for opl emulator. Suggested value
#                is 49716, but other values may also be used.
#OPLSampleRate=49716

# SurroundOPLOffset: Indicates the frequency offset of surround opl. The default and
#                    recommended value is 384.0, but other values may also be used.
#SurroundOPLOffset=384.0

# ResampleQuality: Indicates the resample quality, valid values from 0 to 4 (default).
#                  Larger value indicates higher quality and higher hardware requirement.
#ResampleQuality=4

# AudioBufferSize: Indicates the size of audio buffer in samples. Valid values are in 
#                  range 2 - 32768, but should be power of 2. Default value is 1024.
#AudioBufferSize=1024

# Volume: Indicates the global volume. Valid values are from 0 to 100, default is 100.
#Volume=100

# WindowWidth: Indicates the width of game window. Default value varies on different
#              platforms. On desktop, the default value is 640.
#WindowWidth=640

# WindowHeight: Indicates the height of game window. Default value varies on different
#               platforms. On desktop, the default value is 400.
#WindowHeight=400

# FullScreen: Indicates whether the game should started fullscreen or not, default is not.
#             On some platforms, such as mobile OS or WinRT, this option is ignored.
#FullScreen=0

# KeepAspectRatio: Indicates whether the content in game window should keep its original
#                  aspect ratio (default) or not. When aspect ratio is kept, there may be
#                  left/right or top/bottom black edges in the game window. Currently this
#                  value is only valid if the game is built with SDL 2.0 or higher, otherwise
#                  this value is ignored.
#KeepAspectRatio=1

# MessageFileName: Indicates whether to use external message files.
#MessageFileName=jm.msg

# FontFileName: Indicates whether to use external font files. Currently supports only BDF font.
#FontFileName=jp.bdf

# LogLevel: This value controls how many logs can be output by the program. Valid ranges are:
# 0 (Verbose), 1 (Debug), 2 (Informational), 3 (Warning), 4 (Error) and 5 (Fatal). Only logs
# whose levels are larger or equal to this value can be output.
#LogLevel=5

# LogFileName: When set, the program's log will be output to this file as well.
#LogFileName=sdlpal.log

# AudioDevice: The ID of audio device to use. Only supported when compiled with SDL2. If this
#              item is set to a negative value (default), the default audio device will be used.
#AudioDevice=-1
