# CodePage: Indicates the codepage to use, 0 for big5 (default), 1 for gbk,
#           2 for shift-jis.
#CodePage=0

# DOS: Indicates whether to use DOS-version resources or WIN-version resources.
#      Non-zero for DOS-version (default), zero for WIN95-version.
#DOS=1

# UseEmbeddedFonts: Indicates whether to use DOS-version's embedded fonts.
#                   Non-zero for using DOS-version's embedded fonts (default),
#                   zero for using SDLPAL's internal fonts.
# Note that this value is ignored when the DOS option is zero.
#UseEmbeddedFonts=1

# CD: Indicates which type of CD audio source to use. Valid types include 'RAW',
#     'OGG' and 'MP3'. 'RAW' means use the SDL 1.2's CDAudio API (default when
#     compiled with SDL 1.2), 'OGG' means use files named as '100xx.ogg' inside
#     the 'ogg' directory (default when compiled with SDL 2.0), while 'MP3'
#     means use files named as '100xx.mp3' inside the 'mp3' directory.
#CD=OGG

# MUSIC: Indicates which type of music source to use. Valid types include 
#        'RIX', 'MIDI', 'OGG' and 'MP3'. 'RIX' means use the RIX music (default),
#        'MIDI' means midi (either in 'mus.mkf' or inside 'musics' directory),
#        'OGG' means use files named as 'xx.ogg' inside the 'ogg' directory, while
#        'MP3' means use files named as 'xx.mp3' inside the 'mp3' directory.
#MUSIC=RIX

# OPL: Indicates which type of OPL emulator to use. Valid types include 'DOSBOX'
#      (default), 'MAME' and 'DOSBOXNEW'. 'DOSBOXNEW' is the recommended OPL simulator
#      on high-performance devices like PC or tablet. However, for lower-end phones,
#      'DOSBOX' is the best choice for performance-quality balance.
#OPL=DOSBOX

# Stereo: Indicates whether to use mono audio or stereo audio. Non-zero means to use
#         stereo audio (default), while zero means only use mono audio.
#Stereo=1

# UseSurroundOPL: Indicates whether to use surround opl emulator or not. Non-zero
#                 means to using (default), while zero means not to use. Only
#                 valid when Stereo is set to non-zero.
#UseSurroundOPL=1

# SampleRate: Indicates which sample rate to use, valid values include 44100 (default),
#             and 22050. Other values (<=48000) are supported but not recommended.
#SampleRate=44100

# OPLSampleRate: Indicates which sample rate to use for opl emulator. Suggested value
#                is 49716, but other values may also be used.
#OPLSampleRate=49716

# SurroundOPLOffset: Indicates the frequency offset of surround opl. The default and
#                    recommended value is 384.0, but other values may also be used.
#SurroundOPLOffset=384.0

# ResampleQuality: Indicates the resample quality, valid values from 0 to 4 (default).
#                  Larger value indicates higher quality and higher hardware requirement.
#ResampleQuality=4

# AudioBufferSize: Indicates the size of audio buffer in samples. Valid values are in 
#                  range 2 - 32768, but should be power of 2. Default value is 1024.
#AudioBufferSize=1024

# Volume: Indicates the global volume. Valid values are from 0 to 100, default is 100.
#Volume=100

# WindowWidth: Indicates the width of game window. Default value varies on different
#              platforms. On desktop, the default value is 640.
#WindowWidth=640

# WindowHeight: Indicates the height of game window. Default value varies on different
#               platforms. On desktop, the default value is 400 for non-fullsceen mode,
#               and 480 for full-screen mode.
#WindowHeight=400

# FullScreen: Indicates whether the game should started fullscreen or not, default is not.
#             Currently only valid when the game is built with SDL 1.2 builds. If the game
#             is built with SDL 2.0 or higher, this value is ignored.
#FullScreen=0

# KeepAspectRatio: Indicates whether the content in game window should keep its original
#                  aspect ratio (default) or not. When aspect ratio is kept, there may be
#                  left/right or top/bottom black edges in the game window. Currently this
#                  value is only valid if the game is built with SDL 2.0 or higher, otherwise
#                  this value is ignored.
#KeepAspectRatio=1

# MessageFileName: Indicates whether to use external message files.
#MessageFileName=jm.msg
