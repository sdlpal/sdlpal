#UseSurroundOPL=1

# SampleRate: Indicates which sample rate to use, valid values include 44100 (default),

#                is 49716, but other values may also be used.
#OPLSampleRate=49716

# SurroundOPLOffset: Indicates the frequency offset of surround opl. The default and

# ResampleQuality: Indicates the resample quality, valid values from 0 to 4 (default).
#                  Larger value indicates higher quality and higher hardware requirement.
#ResampleQuality=4

# AudioBufferSize: Indicates the size of audio buffer in samples. Valid values are in 
#                  range 2 - 32768, but should be power of 2. Default value is 1024.

#WindowHeight=400

# FullScreen: Indicates whether the game should started fullscreen or not, default is not.
#             Currently only valid when the game is built with SDL 1.2 builds. If the game

#FullScreen=0

# KeepAspectRatio: Indicates whether the content in game window should keep its original
#                  aspect ratio (default) or not. When aspect ratio is kept, there may be
#                  left/right or top/bottom black edges in the game window. Currently this
#                  value is only valid if the game is built with SDL 2.0 or higher, otherwise
#                  this value is ignored.
#KeepAspectRatio=1

# MessageFileName: Indicates whether to use external message & word files. Only need to specify
#                  main file name, the extensions are automatically appended by SDLPAL. The
#                  '.msg' file is the message file, the '.idx' file is the index file, and the
#                  '.wrd' file is the word file. All files have the format '<idx>=<content>',
#                  where the start value of <idx> are 0 for the index file and 1 for the other
#                  two files. Note that, the <content> of the index file is a series of numbers
#                  spearated by commas, and each number is one of the <idx>s in the message
#                  file, while value '0' means wait for key and value '-1' means end. And the
#                  <idx> of the index file is the value of the first 0xFFFF instruction of one
#                  dialog in SSS.MKF. By default, this option is disabled. All such files should
#                  be UTF-8 encoded, without leading BOM bytes.
